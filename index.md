## About Me

Hi, my name is Alina Leidinger and I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/">ILLC</a> at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by <a href="https://www.shutova.org/">Katia Shutova</a> and <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/People/person/1405/Prof-dr-Robert-van-Rooij">Robert van Rooij</a>. In my PhD, I work on implicit bias and stereotypes in large Language Models. My research topic lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Ethical AI and explainability.
